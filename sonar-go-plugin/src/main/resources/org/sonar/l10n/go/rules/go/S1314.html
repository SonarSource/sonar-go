<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Integer literals starting with a zero are octal rather than decimal values. While using octal values is fully supported, most developers do not
have experience with them. They may not recognize octal values as such, mistaking them instead for decimal values.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
func printTen() {
	myNumber := 010 // Noncompliant. myNumber will hold 8, not 10 - was this really expected?
	fmt.Println(myNumber)
}
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
func printTen() {
	myNumber := 10
	fmt.Println(myNumber)
}
</pre>
